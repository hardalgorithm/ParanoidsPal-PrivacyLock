 These days, maintaining privacy on our devices has become increasingly challenging. With so much of our personal information stored on our phones, it’s essential to ensure it stays protected, whether from accidental access or malicious intent. Imagine situations where someone unlocks your phone while you're unaware or a scammer forces access. These scenarios are all too real in today's world.

That’s why I developed <i>Paranoid's Pal - Privacy Lock</i> It’s designed to offer an extra layer of security on top of Android’s built-in features. Here’s what makes Paranoid's Pal stand out:

    • Instant Lock with Shake: In urgent situations, just shake your phone, and it locks immediately, ensuring quick protection when you need it.

    • Automatic Screen Lock: Your phone locks automatically once the screen turns off, ensuring it's secure even when you're not actively using it.
